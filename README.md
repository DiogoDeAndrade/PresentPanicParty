# Present Panic Party

Created for the Christmas Jam at Lusófona University. In this game jam, we'd receive a request for a game from Santa (and we wrote one for the other particpants), mine was making a multiplayer couch game with elfs that threw coal to slow each other, and stealing presents; the Krampus was also on the request.

## Game

Present Panic Party is a frantic local couch-party game for 2–4 players where the true spirit of the season is stealing, sabotaging, and surviving.
Dash around the arena collecting presents, snatching gifts from your rivals, turning into the mighty Krampus, and hurling coal to slow down anyone who gets too greedy.
Every match spirals into delicious chaos as exploding gifts, surprise power-ups, and last-second betrayals turn a cozy holiday gathering into total festive mayhem.
Perfect for a quick burst of laughter — or a full evening of shouting “THAT WAS MY PRESENT!”

🎮 Instructions

Grab 2 to 4 friends and jump in.
Your goal is simple: collect presents and deliver them to your bag - you can deliver them to someone else’s bag… but honestly, where’s the fun in that?

Pick up the yellow essences scattered around the map.
